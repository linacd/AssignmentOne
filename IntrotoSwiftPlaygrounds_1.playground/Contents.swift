//We are going to create a statement that compares the two variables and assign that state to a third variable

//Completed part 1-6

//Part 7 On your own:
// I will create two new variables and assign those variable to two different strings

var newvar1: String

//I will create a third variable that is to the statement that evaluates my newvar1 and newvar2 to equal to each other

//Part 8 On your own: completed
